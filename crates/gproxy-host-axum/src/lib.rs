//! The native HTTP host: an axum router over [`gproxy_app::App`].
//!
//! # What this crate refuses to decide
//!
//! Every question of product behaviour has an answer somewhere below this
//! crate, and nothing here is allowed to give a second one. It does not decide
//! who a caller is ([`Authenticator`](gproxy_app::Authenticator)), what they
//! may reach ([`Admission`](gproxy_app::Admission)), which provider serves a
//! model (the sdk's resolver), what a failure is worth
//! ([`AppError::status_code`](gproxy_app::AppError::status_code)) or what an
//! operation does ([`Operations`](gproxy_app::Operations)). It decides how
//! bytes become those calls and how their answers become bytes: routing,
//! header and body decoding, CORS, the client address, the mount grammar, the
//! two error envelopes, streaming, and the lifetime of a rate-limit lease.
//!
//! That boundary is why a second host ([`gproxy-host-edge`]) can exist at all.
//! If anything product-shaped lived here, the edge deployment would have to
//! reimplement it and the two would drift.
//!
//! # The route table
//!
//! | Route | What it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `GET /healthz` | liveness and the published revision |
//! | `GET /publications/{id}` | a published body, by its capability id |
//! | `/admin/api/*` | the operator surface, one `MethodRouter` per operation |
//! | `/admin/api/update` | self-update, **only when the host supplied an [`UpdateService`]** |
//! | `/portal/api/*` | the end user's surface, plus `login` and `logout` |
//! | everything else | [`ingress`], in the order that module documents |
//!
//! The management surfaces are explicit routes rather than a hand-rolled path
//! parser: axum decides the method, the path and the 404/405, and a typo in a
//! route is a compile-time missing handler instead of a silently unreachable
//! branch.
//!
//! # The lease-lifetime rule
//!
//! [`CallOutcome::admitted`](gproxy_app::CallOutcome) holds the request's
//! rate-limit charges, and a concurrency permit measures requests *in flight*.
//! A streamed response is in flight long after `App::call` returned, so the
//! host must hold the `Admitted` until the last byte has been written. This
//! crate does that by giving the response body a wrapper stream
//! ([`response::LeasedBody`]) that **owns** the decision: the lease, the
//! downstream capture and core's settlement future all live inside the stream
//! and are only released when it ends. Nothing has to remember to drop
//! anything, because there is nowhere else the values are held.
//!
//! A websocket is the same rule with a longer clock. [`websocket`] moves the
//! same [`response::Trailer`] into the duplex pump, so a realtime session that
//! runs for an hour holds its concurrency permit for that hour and gives it
//! back when the socket closes — not when the `101` was written.
//!
//! # A client that goes away cancels the upstream call
//!
//! The same values, for the same reason. A client never says it is leaving: the
//! departure is a *drop* — of the handler future before a head was written, of
//! the response body mid-stream — so the request's cancellation token is owned
//! by a guard ([`response::CancelOnDrop`]) that fires on `Drop`, and the guard
//! travels with the rest of the request's state into [`response::LeasedBody`].
//! A socket cancels explicitly instead, because its pump is a task hyper spawned
//! and there is no handler future left to drop.
//!
//! The guard is disarmed the moment the response reaches its own end. Core reads
//! the token when it decides between `Completed` and `Cancelled`, so a token
//! fired after the last byte would record a finished request as an abandoned
//! one. [`response::CancelOnDrop`] has the whole rule.
//!
//! # One router, two targets
//!
//! This crate builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as well as for a native
//! target, and [`gproxy-host-edge`] mounts *this* [`Router`] inside a Workers
//! fetch handler rather than writing the route table a second time. Everything
//! that differs between the two is socket-shaped and named by a `cfg`:
//!
//! | Native only | Why |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`console`] | `rust-embed` and a filesystem; a Worker serves its console from Workers Assets |
//! | [`peer_ip`] | `ConnectInfo` is axum's `tokio` feature, and a Worker has `cf-connecting-ip` instead |
//!
//! No route is in that table, and none may join it. `/admin/api/update` is not
//! an exception to it: the routes are target-independent and compile for wasm
//! like everything else here, and their absence at the edge comes from the
//! edge host handing [`HostState::with_updates`] nothing — a *runtime* fact,
//! not a `cfg`. See [`update`].
//!
//! The one thing the wasm build asks of every handler is [`send`]. On that
//! target the engine below this crate is `!Send` on purpose — a JS transport
//! handle belongs to the isolate that made it — while axum's
//! [`Handler`](axum::handler::Handler) requires `Future: Send`. Wrapping a
//! handler's body in [`send`] bridges the two, costs nothing natively, and
//! fails the wasm build loudly at the one handler that forgot it rather than
//! quietly anywhere else.
